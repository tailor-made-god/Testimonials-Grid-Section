# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section

![Design preview for the Testimonials grid section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This Design is developed using basic Html and Css. In Css flex is used inside the card and to align grid is used outside the card. Also their is a background image in the first card where I first time used in my design.

This design is quit complicated considered I am a beginner, but the layers which makes it looks difficult other than that the process is the same.

Hope you find it closer to the design.
